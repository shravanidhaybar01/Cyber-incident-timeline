# Cyber-incident-timeline
Cyber attack timeline simulation project 
# Cyber Incident Timeline Generator 🛡

## What is this project?
This project shows how a cybersecurity analyst
reconstructs an attack using security events.

## Real-World Use Case
This project simulates how SOC analysts and DFIR teams reconstruct
attack timelines during incidents like phishing, malware, or ransomware.
Such timelines are critical for root cause analysis and reporting.

## Key Features
- Parses security log events
- Sorts events chronologically
- Generates incident timeline
- Assigns basic risk level
- Helps visualize attack progression

## Why I made this?
To understand real-world incident response
instead of only running tools.

## What does it do?
- Reads security logs
- Sorts them by time
- Creates an incident timeline
- Shows risk level

## Technology Used
- Python
- File handling
